  <p>Organized and recorded ideas about mathematics, not guarantee correctness, readability, completeness of details, have guess without proof. Currently many of them are just <strong>draft</strong>. Probably always in anytime need to modify wrong thing or need improve bad treatment or need delete and change lots of things</p>
  <p>If you are familiar with mathematics, you can look at <a href="https://ecbc0.github.io/item/feature.html">feature</a> and see what is better in this note compared to the mainstream treatment.</p>
  <p>(The magnifying glass icon in the upper left corner, or <code>s</code> key open, <code>esc</code> close) Use the search function to search for label. Example: for the underlined <code>123</code>, the address is followed by <code>#456</code> (click the underlined text to see it in the browser address bar), you should enter <code>[456]</code> or <code>[456</code> in the search box. (this operation should be automated by javascript, but I don't know how) You can also use the <a href="https://github.com/ecbc0/note-math">typst file</a> and the preview function of <a href="https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/tinymist">tinymist</a> to view this document.</p>
  <p>Typst's HTML output is not yet complete, so the display effect may not be very good</p>
